# quality-assurance-framework-for-evaluation-of-text-generation-models
report on the accuracy evaluation of text generation models


This paper presents a comprehensive Quality Assurance Framework designed specifically for text generation models. 
Our approach combines automated metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity scores with novel techniques for coherence and 
factuality assessment. We integrate human evaluation methodologies to ensure a balanced assessment of linguistic quality, 
coherence, factual accuracy, and diversity in generated texts. Through extensive experimentation across different text generation 
tasks, our framework demonstrates improved evaluation accuracy and provides valuable insights for model refinement and 
optimization, contributing to the advancement of trustworthy text generation models.
