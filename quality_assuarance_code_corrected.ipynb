            "However, Dostoevsky’s intention, at this point in his career, was likely more social than religious. “The Christmas Tree and A Wedding” conforms to the style in vogue at the time of its publishing, in 1848, by protesting the social evils suffered by the defenseless at the hands of the powerful. Dostoevsky was a new and heavily indebted writer on the scene of St. Petersburg. Established writers and critics of the Natural School had warmly welcomed him into their fold after the publishing of his debut novel, Poor Folk, in which Dostoevsky’s “masterly delineation of character and the social conditions of his heroes” is on display.3 The central social theme of Poor Folk is “Dostoevsky’s variant of the same plea” one finds in Hugo and in Dickens — the plea addressed to the wealthy and powerful to assume some moral responsibility for their less fortunate brothers.”4 Dostoevsky may have been writing in this vein partially because it was popular and because it sold well. Always sensitive to the intellectual trends running through St. Petersburg, he would later define his work by bucking and criticizing the trends; however, he started his career by following the trends.\n",

            " Dostoevsky's early work, including \"The Christmas Tree and A Wedding,\" focused on social issues and protested against the mistreatment of the vulnerable by the wealthy and powerful. This adherence to the Natural School's style was strategically motivated, as it aligned with popular literary trends and appealed to a wide audience. Dostoevsky's aim was to highlight the responsibility of the privileged towards the less fortunate, a theme influenced by the works of Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens.\n",
